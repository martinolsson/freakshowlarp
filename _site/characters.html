<p><img src="assets/images/barnum-bailey.jpg" class="image fit" alt="Barnum Bailey Gang" /></p>

<p>Read through the roles listed here. When you’ve chosen one or more roles you like, go ahead and <a href="apply.html">apply to take part!</a>. The roles are quite open to interpretation and we will work together with you to flesh them out. Some of the roles have <strong>special requirements</strong> in the form of makeup, props or other preparations. Information about these requirements are listed with the character.</p>

This seems to frighten your mothers for some reason. You despise the normals. They don’t know what it means to be free, so you try to show them. Their hate is just stupidity.

You drink too much and everyday the problems of a nomadic life become a little harder. But at night, in your dreams, the solution is right before you. You just forget what it is when you wake up.

But you are a sunny person. You love to spend time with people, stay together, make things and make people happy. Maybe your time here is finished. Who can bear a clown losing their smile? It’s better to go away than do that to all the others.

                            People see these folk are freaks, but you don’t get that; you can’t see them – see. Some folks say that those who can’t see often hear more to compensate. That’s kind of true, but on the whole it is a load of bull. Cataracts turned the world to mist and now you see shapes, outlines. What you hear is the music. There is jazz and syncopation and sometimes what you call “a strange melody.” The circus has this music playing; it comes from the people in it, and they give the world of mist a colour and soul.

The first time you had it was like God’s own embrace; the heat of the stuff burning through your veins and into your heart.  Now the music is just a way to take away the pain until it is time for the next fix. At least here in the freak show you’ve got a ready supply of junk. Playing tunes and counting the hours down to the next hit.

You knew even then that you’d give anything to play that music. You gave your future; signed it away at the crossroads in blood just as sure as if you’d put your neck in a noose and stepped up on a scaffold. Ten years, making the world dance, and now your time is nearly up. You gotta pay your debt, or find someone to pay it for you.

                            You could sell snow to the penguins, but it ain’t worth it. Those little bastards don’t have any money! You never hit the big bucks even though you worked your ass off, so you started to sell a miracle cure cooked up from all sorts of fake shit. To your amazement the stuff seems to work, but only while you travel with the freak show. Now people keep coming back for more of the cure. Maybe one day it’ll make you a fortune?

                            You were barely getting by before your wife died at childbirth. Her dwarf body couldn’t handle a normal sized child. You couldn’t give her up, or the income. You had her mummified and carry her around in a box and show her to folks. At night you still talk to her. How can the world be so cruel that the fruit of your love killed her? Is it true that she was an abomination and your love was a sin?

                            All you ever wanted was a puppy to call your own. One followed you home from school once, but your uncle drowned it in the canal. So you ran away and joined the circus. Animals love you, they do what you want them to. But they keep dying. Right now you have no animals, so no act, and the circus folk look at you like it is your fault. The Freaks, well they are more complex than your animals, but some of them are almost as helpless; after all, you are only complete when you have something to look after.

                            You have fasted in the flowering deserts of Oman living only on scent and you have listened to the silence of the gurus in India. At least that’s what you tell them, as you suggestively wave your cheap amulet. They usually play along, but recently it has been turning strange. Maybe it’s true what they say about magic getting stronger in the end times. You sense that this place and time makes your hypnosis deeper and truer, and your desires clearer. You have always needed more, searched for something deeper, that much at least is true.

                            You are a crook. Nothing you "foretell" has any real chance of coming true or being reflected in facts. You simply used the opportunity and snuck into the boss’s office and read everybody’s files putting special attention to remembering their dates of birth, or as many as was possible and/or disclosed. And since then you quote various horoscopes to them and walk away with a focused expression. But really, it’s not even worth a handful of ash. Being able to do real magic would be so great, you would do anything to have real powers.

                            You were mute, and they put you in the school for defective children; they forced you to speak, but found your true voice on stage with the freaks. You’ve had many puppets but it all changed when you found Caspian who is witty and clever on stage and dares to say things that you do not. Lately Caspian has been very rude and has been telling you that you are worthless without him and have nothing to say for yourself anymore. Maybe you should just let Caspian speak for you all the time? After all the puppet is just you, right?
