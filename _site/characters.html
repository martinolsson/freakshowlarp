			<p><p class="lead">You are in the Freak Show because you have no other option. Even if you’re not visibly different, there is something that sets you aside from normal society. Maybe you made yourself different on the outside too even though you weren’t like that to start with.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/barnum-bailey.jpg" class="image fit" alt="Barnum Bailey Gang" /></p>

<p>Read through the roles listed here. When you’ve chosen one or more roles you like, go ahead and <a href="apply.html">apply to take part!</a>. The roles are quite open to interpretation and we will work together with you to flesh them out. Some of the roles have <strong>special requirements</strong> in the form of makeup, props or other preparations. Information about these requirements are listed with the character.</p>

                            Seven years of medical school and a lots of debts. Sure you could leave this mouldy place, but you’ve got nothing to go back to. If you tried to practice medicine they’d throw you in jail. You try to look after these people though. Some of them are sick. When you are not trying to pull together enough money for some medicines you are still practicing your healers art, and one of the people in the show has stolen your heart. It is amazing how one small mistake can change the course of your life; but maybe it has changed for the better.

                            You were born to be a clown. Your grandparent's grandparents were clowns. When you are on stage you are alive. Everybody loves clowns. Your life was just perfect, but you screwed everything. Sooner or later the truth will come out. Waiting for the shit to hit the fan, you tend to be depressive. You drink too much and everyday the problems of a nomadic life become a little harder. But at night, in your dreams, the solution is right before you. You just forget what it is when you wake up. The answer lies with the freak show, you know it in your heart.

                            You remember a time when being a clown was everything, but that was long ago. Clowning is a hard job. Having ideas, doing shows, making people laugh. It’s tiring. But you are a sunny person. You love to spend time with people, stay together, make things and make people happy. Maybe your time here is finished. Who can bear a clown losing their smile? It’s better to go away than do that to all the others.

                            People see these folk are freaks, but you don’t get that; you can’t see them – see. Some folks say that those who can’t see often hear more to compensate. That’s kind of true, but on the whole it is a load of bull. Cataracts turned the world to mist and now you see shapes, outlines. What you hear is the music. There is jazz and syncopation and sometimes what you call “a strange melody.” The circus has this music playing; it comes from the people in it, and they give the world of mist a colour and soul.

                            The road to rock and roll is the road to ruin. It was fun for a while. Life on the road. Tourbus ‘romance’ - a new conquest every night.  Sex, rock’n’roll and drugs...  The first time you had it was like God’s own embrace; the heat of the stuff burning through your veins and into your heart.  Now the music is just a way to take away the pain until it is time for the next fix. At least here in the freak show you’ve got a ready supply of junk. Playing tunes and counting the hours down to the next hit.

Ten years, making the world dance, and now your time is nearly up. You gotta pay your debt, or find someone to pay it for you.

Maybe it’s true what they say about magic getting stronger in the end times. You sense that this place and time makes your hypnosis deeper and truer, and your desires clearer. You have always needed more, searched for something deeper, that much at least is true.

                            You were mute, and they put you in the school for defective children; they forced you to speak, but found your true voice on stage with the freaks. You’ve had many puppets but it all changed when you found Caspian who is witty and clever on stage and dares to say things that you do not. Lately Caspian has been very rude and has been telling you that you are worthless without him and have nothing to say for yourself anymore. Maybe you should just let Caspian speak for you all the time? After all the puppet is just you, right?
