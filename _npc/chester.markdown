description: You thought there was an opportunity here. Who doesn’t love freaks? The
  audience used to come, but the sisters have gathered the shittiest freaks and you
  can’t make ends meet. You should ditch the scum and hire some real talent because
  you really hate the situation and hated it for a long time. Time is running out
  now, and fast.
