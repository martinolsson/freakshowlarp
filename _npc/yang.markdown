title: Yang
position: 11
role: Clown
affinity: Circus
description: You remember a time when being a clown was everything, but that was long
  ago. Clowning is a hard job. Having ideas, doing shows, making people laugh. It’s
  tiring. But you are a sunny person. You love to spend time with people, stay together,
  make things and make people happy. Maybe your time here is finished. Who can bear
  a clown losing their smile? It’s better to go away than do that to all the others.
