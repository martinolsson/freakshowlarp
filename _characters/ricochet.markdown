  of stocking top, red red lips, and eyes that look like infinity. Perhaps some folk
  have a doubt that you belong with the freaks, but they don’t know you.The freaks
  do.They know that your eyes are not your own and that the ink on your skin ain’t
  right. Some people have tattoos of monsters on their skin, but those tattoos are
  just pictures. Your ink is more than that, the monsters are real.
