title: Atlas
position: 5
role: Janitor
affinity: Circus
description: You were the strongest of the strong, but then you broke your back. Even
  weak and crippled, you never left the show. You couldn’t marry and live a lie. Now
  you are the janitor and keep everything tidy. You may be outcasts, but you are not  pigs.
  You also take care of the young and lost ones, who remind you of yourself when you
  were younger. But sometimes, when the night falls, you feel regret.
