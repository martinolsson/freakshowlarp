title: Claw
position: 32
role: Performer
affinity: Freaks
description: You should count yourself among the lucky. It could have been your best
  hand, or it could have been both. You smile and wave. Yes, you would like to be
  able to caress the one you love (who does not love you) and of course life would
  be better without the ugly, scary hand. So much better. You cry a little and think
  for the thousandth time of the sharp tools in the shed. Maybe the electric hedge-trimmer
  is your best bet. You cannot be whole until that dreaded thing is gone.
requirements: lobster claw hand prop, having a stage act
