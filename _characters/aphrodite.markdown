title: Aphrodite
position: 14
role: Burlesque artist
affinity: Freaks
description: The spirit of rock and roll personified.  An avatar of sex, drugs, and
  rock’n’roll in human form, from the moment of adoration of the performer on the
  stage to the beaten down tour thing, exhausted from the road.  Demure bleed leopard
  print and artful sleaze.  What are you rebelling against?  What have you got?
