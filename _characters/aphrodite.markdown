  rock’n’roll in human form, from the moment of adoration of the performer on the

27) Name: Jade or Jay Moonshine ++
Affinity: Freak
Role: Burlesque artist
Groups: Freak, Performer, young, old
Description: Some folks think that you take the retro-look too far; but this ain’t retro, darlin’ you’ve lived it.  This look is original.  Sometime around the middle of the 20th century you stopped aging.  You must be well over a hundred now and still going strong.  A person out of time and - without the freakshow - out of place too.  But who’d want to grow old, when you can look and move like this?
