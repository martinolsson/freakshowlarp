An avatar of sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll in human form, from the moment of adoration of the performer on the stage to the beaten down tour thing, exhausted from the road.

27) Name: Jade or Jay Moonshine ++
Affinity: Freak
Role: Burlesque artist
Groups: Freak, Performer, young, old
Description: Some folks think that you take the retro-look too far; but this ain’t retro, darlin’ you’ve lived it.  This look is original.  Sometime around the middle of the 20th century you stopped aging.  You must be well over a hundred now and still going strong.  A person out of time and - without the freakshow - out of place too.  But who’d want to grow old, when you can look and move like this?
