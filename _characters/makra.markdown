title: Mäkrä
position: 26
role: Witch
affinity: Freaks
description: Speaking and taming the nature, the force that runs through all, courses
  through you as a birth gift as does the mark on your flesh. Sometimes it’s a joining
  of bodies, sometimes a plant, sometimes pain in the right spot. You know how to
  untangle the knots of existing. Your tendencies didn’t fit with the village folk
  so you ran with the freaks. They appreciate you and come to you for advice.
requirements: A port-wine stain that is large and clearly visible, items and spells
  for ritual magic and practising it in game
