description: Seven years of medical school and a lots of debts. Sure you could leave
  this mouldy place, but you’ve got nothing to go back to. If you tried to practice
  medicine they’d throw you in jail. You try to look after these people though. Some
  of them are sick. When you are not trying to pull together enough money for some
  medicines you are still practicing your healers art, and one of the people in the
  show has stolen your heart. It is amazing how one small mistake can change the course
  of your life; but maybe it has changed for the better.
