title: Guts Malone
role: Musician
affinity: Circus
description: The road to rock and roll is the road to ruin. It was fun for a while.
  Life on the road. Tourbus ‘romance’ - a new conquest every night.  Sex, rock’n’roll
  and drugs...  The first time you had it was like God’s own embrace; the heat of
  the stuff burning through your veins and into your heart.  Now the music is just
  a way to take away the pain until it is time for the next fix. At least here in
  the freak show you’ve got a ready supply of junk. Playing tunes and counting the
  hours down to the next hit.
requirements: A musical instrument and skills to play it
