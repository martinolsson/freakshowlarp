title: The Invisible Person
position: 24
role: stagehand, ex-performer
affinity: Freaks
description: After the incident you haven’t been able turn invisible. You can do it
  sometimes, but not on stage in front of an audience, not anymore. You practice so
  hard every day. You’re sure you can get it back. You have to, you’re nobody without
  it. Sometimes you are so angry, why did this happen to you? You used to draw in
  the crowds, now you could just walk out and start a normal life for God’s sake!
