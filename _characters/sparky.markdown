title: Sparky
position: 14
role: Fire Artist
affinity: Circus
description: It was the house's faulty electric wiring. It might also have been the
  sun shining at an angle through the window. The fire broke out in your play room,
  in the attic of the house. You wanted to rescue your toys, the wooden painted ones
  - your favourites. The window burst with heat and the gust breathed the fire into
  you. Somebody pulled you out, but the skin never looked as it should have. You are
  scarred all over. You are the only one in the Freak Show with money (although you
  don't let it show too much). You escaped with the circus from a boarding school
  your parents chose for you far away from home. It's better this way. No one bullies
  you for the scars, for crying, for looking monstrous or just different. The parents
  never stopped sending the cash, and it helps to cover for the basic expenses and
  repairs.
