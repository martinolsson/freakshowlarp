title: Tailor
position: 7
role: Costume Maker
affinity: Circus
description: You totally love the unusual; the freaks push all of your buttons and
  being around them gets you very excited. These desires have become all-encompassing
  to the extent that you donâ€™t really think about the morality of your desires. Dressing
  someone is like giving him another life, a new skin. They are your creature. You
  want to protect them, to keep them close to you. The freaks are the way to gratification
  and perhaps, who knows, something more? They love you.
requirements: Tailor gear and some fabrics as props for your profession
