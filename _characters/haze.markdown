title: Haze
role: Hypnotist
affinity: Circus
description: You have fasted in the flowering deserts of Oman living only on scent and you have listened to the silence of the gurus in India. At least that’s what you tell them, as you suggestively wave your cheap amulet. They usually play along, but recently it has been turning strange. Maybe it’s true what they say about magic getting stronger in the end times. You sense that this place and time makes your hypnosis deeper and truer, and your desires clearer. You have always needed more, searched for something deeper, that much at least is true.
