description: You could sell snow to the penguins, but it ain’t worth it. Those little
  bastards don’t have any money! You never hit the big bucks even though you worked
  your ass off, so you started to sell a miracle cure cooked up from all sorts of
  fake shit. To your amazement the stuff seems to work, but only while you travel
  with the freak show. Now people keep coming back for more of the cure. Maybe one
  day it’ll make you a fortune?
