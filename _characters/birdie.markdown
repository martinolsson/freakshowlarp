title: Birdie
position: 32
affinity: Freaks
role: Drug Dealer
description: Your body is covered with feathers. Wearing clothes is difficult and
  uncomfortable. Your mom called you a curse, a punishment from God.  Your life was
  hard, but then you found these people and with them a kind of freedom. Sometimes
  someone unkind comes to the circus, so you share some magic with them, get them
  hooked, reel them in, take their cash and burn them out. Just like you did with
  your mom. Some can take more, some can't. They have sweet dreams before they go.
requirements: feathery costume / prop-glue feathers to skin, prop drugs to sell
