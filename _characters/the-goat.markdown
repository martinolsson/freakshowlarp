description: You are lost amongst the sea of cities, the vineyards you no longer can

  You tell tales of mighty Zeus and of festivals held by Dionysus. You inhale the
  magic dusts singing of wine and women, or do you just dream? You may guide those
  in need, but you may also lead them astray. Your home may be gone forever, but your
  new family you hold dear to you.
