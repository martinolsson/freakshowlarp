description: It's was a passion, getting inked. The pictures on your skin melded into
  each other and created new meanings. You felt a constant urge to change your body,
  but are running out of options; there isn't much of you that hasn't been inked or
  pierced. Your passion now is for changing who other people are through body modification.
  Marks, scars, cuttings all leave an impact on the body that was there before. You
  wield a subtle knife and with it you can change the world.
requirements: Lots of tattoos including facial tattoos and other body modifications
