title: Renaldo/Renata the All Seeing
position: 30
role: Fortune teller
affinity: Circus
description: You are a crook. Nothing you "foretell" has any real chance of coming
  true or being reflected in facts. You simply used the opportunity and snuck into
  the boss’s office and read everybody’s files putting special attention to remembering
  their dates of birth, or as many as was possible and/or disclosed. And since then
  you quote various horoscopes to them and walk away with a focused expression. But
  really, it’s not even worth a handful of ash. Being able to do real magic would
  be so great, you would do anything to have real powers.
requirements: Arabic exotic clothing, crystal ball, astrology charts
