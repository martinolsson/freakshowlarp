description: The Lord moves in the most mysterious of ways. The child with the face
  of a wolf who nobody wanted was taken in and raised by the Catholic church far to
  the South. How could you repay their kindness but to take a vocation and enter the
  Church as a priest. After many years you found a parish … in the circus. You are
  not sure whether these freaks are sinners or saints, but they are surely a part
  of God’s great plan, and the End Times are coming.

  canine teeth.
