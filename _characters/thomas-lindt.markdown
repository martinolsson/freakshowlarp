description: You were barely getting by before your wife died at childbirth. Her dwarf
  body couldn’t handle a normal sized child. You couldn’t give her up, or the income.
  You had her mummified and carry her around in a box and show her to folks. At night
  you still talk to her. How can the world be so cruel that the fruit of your love
  killed her? Is it true that she was an abomination and your love was a sin?
requirements: a dwarf mummy in a display box, looking like a man
