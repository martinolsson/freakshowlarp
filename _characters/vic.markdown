description: Choosing is overrated. Black and white distinctions are for limited people.
  They have hated you since your birth, because you don’t want to choose. You are
  different, you are a challenge to what the people pretend to know. And so what?
  They don’t like you? Fine. Let’s test their limits make them shocked. It’s funny,
  it’s liberating, but sometimes it hurts. Maybe one day you will stop and try to
  live an ordinary life. Always being the rebel is consuming you.
