title: Ebony or Ivory Jones
role: Musician
affinity: Circus
description: People see these folk are freaks, but you don’t get that; you can’t see
  them – see. Some folks say that those who can’t see often hear more to compensate.
  That’s kind of true, but on the whole it is a load of bull. Cataracts turned the
  world to mist and now you see shapes, outlines. What you hear is the music. There
  is jazz and syncopation and sometimes what you call “a strange melody.” The circus
  has this music playing; it comes from the people in it, and they give the world
  of mist a colour and soul.
requirements: A musical instrument and skills to play it, being or playing an almost
  completely blind person
