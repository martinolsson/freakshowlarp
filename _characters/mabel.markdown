title: Mabel
position: 28
role: Conjoined twin
affinity: Freaks
description: Education is everything; you are an avid reader and a teacher. You take
  pleasure in art and music and fine food and romance. You are a poet, an occasional
  painter in water colours, and a writer of short plays. With Spider you are as close
  as twins will ever be and your love is all encompassing.  But you argue and fight
  terribly sometimes and the fact that you hurt Spider is tearing you apart.
requirements: You are joined to Spider at the hip, you will need to play together
  in a harness and shared clothes and perform an act on stage together.
