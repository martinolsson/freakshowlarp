role: Handyman and effects specialist
description: People die but machines are forever. Machines can be fixed, and with
  a perfect machine, anything is possible, so you decided to make her anew from metal.
  One day you will  get her back! They treated you like a fool with all your ideas
  about life and death so you joined the freak show to pursue your goal. It will be
  amazing. Sometimes you try to explain what youâ€™re trying to achieve, but again and
  again you realize how useless it is and just prefer being the handyman.
