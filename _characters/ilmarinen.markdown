affinity: Circus
role: Handyman and effects specialist
description: People die but machines are forever. Machines can be fixed, and with
  a perfect machine, anything is possible, so you decided to make her anew from metal.
  One day you will  get her back! They treated you like a fool with all your ideas
  about life and death so you joined the freak show to pursue your goal. It will be
  amazing. Sometimes you try to explain what you’re trying to achieve, but again and
  again you realize how useless it is and just prefer being the handyman.
