title: The Paraca
position: 38
role: The Last Of The Paracas
affinity: Freaks
description: You are the last of your people. Everything from the shape of your head,
  the colour of your skin to the look in your eyes tells the viewer that you are different,
  you are not quite human. Your own language sounds alien to them, there is no shared
  context with these creatures. Your home and tribe is lost, you are alone. You have
  learned the language of these strange people, learned to eat their strange food
  and to follow their customs, but it is hard. Not long ago you started to hear stories
  that there was another like you, searching for you. You should be happy, but right
  now this seems more frightening, almost as though you are being hunted.
requirements: An elongated skull prop, having a stage act presenting Paraca culture
