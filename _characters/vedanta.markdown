title: Vedanta the Voice
position: 21
role: Ventriloquist
affinity: Circus
description: You were mute, and they put you in the school for defective children;
  they forced you to speak, but found your true voice on stage with the freaks. Youâ€™ve
  had many puppets but it all changed when you found Caspian who is witty and clever
  on stage and dares to say things that you do not. Lately Caspian has been very rude
  and has been telling you that you are worthless without him and have nothing to
  say for yourself anymore. Maybe you should just let Caspian speak for you all the
  time? After all the puppet is just you, right?
requirements: Ventriloquist doll, knack for dual personalities.
